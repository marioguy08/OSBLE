1. Retro Topics

    - Consider working with one server.js file
    - We discussed about changes the schemas we currently have
    - Talked about Next steps
    
2. Things that are going well:
    - The front end is set up to be easily integrated with the backend once we have finished there.
    - Gaining a better understanding of what works and what doesn't
3. Things that are not going well:
    - Integrating our individual changes on the backend through seperate files was not as simple as we expected,
      thus we havent been able to connect the front end and back end.
    - Our schemas still need some adjusting to be suitable to the app.
   
4. What can be done to improve the process
    - We discussed consolidating work onto a single branch and making sure our local repo is up to date before making any changes.
      This will allow us to work on a single server file without concerns of merge conflicts, and allow us to work of eachothers progress
      more easily.
