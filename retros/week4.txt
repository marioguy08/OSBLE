Retroactive Meeting Week4

1. Retro Topics
    -Getting pages to work with the data base
    -Assignment of tasks
    -Test Cases
    -Naming conventions
    -Working with last remaining issues
2. Things that are going well:
    -Database schemas are working well
    -Pages look nice and mostly operational
    -Working together and having lots of meetings to discuss issues
3. Things that are not going well:
    -Git Merging having a lot of conflicts
    -Each of us have a seperate local data base
4. What can be done to improve the process
    To improve the process we could figure out how to all use one generalized
    data base. Having seperate data bases for each of us caused some conflicts
    to our code. Also maybe more comments for our code, as blocks of codes would
    sometimes leave us confused. Finally just a better overall understanding of 
    git would smooth out the process.
